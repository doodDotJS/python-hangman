# Python-Hangman
Hi, this is a very simple hangman game, written in Python.

## How to set up.
Just create a new `.py` script and put the content in `index.py` into it.
> This was developed with Python 3.7.0, I'm not sure on how it would run on older versions. If it doesn't work on your version, let me know!

## How to use:
Run the Python file and follow the prompts.
